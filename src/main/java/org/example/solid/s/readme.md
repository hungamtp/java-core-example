# Single responsibility
### Let's begin with the single responsibility principle. As we might expect, this principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

### **Testing** – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.
### **Lower** coupling – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.
### **Organization** – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic ones.
